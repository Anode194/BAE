# AudioEngine Changelog

## Version 0.0.1

This is the initial alpha release of this audio engine. Everything is still very rough and could break at any point and good performance should not be expected. As of right now I can run multiple sounds at the same time without losing real-time execution of the sound loop.

There is no documentation for now, however for future revisions (most likely starting at v1.0.0) I will have a PDF for the documentation of the engine similar to what I have for my other projects that have moved past 0.* versions.
